# CS-350-Emerging-Systems

My most important and interesting project, which best reflects my capabilities as a computer programmer within the realm of embedded systems, is the 7-1 final project. This project is a working thermostat which uses a state machine to manage three settings (off, cooling, heating), pulse width modulation to let LED outputs blink while a cooling or heating mechanism is active, a timer to swap an LCD display's output on its own thread with real-time temperature, setting, and time feedback, and interrupts triggered by button presses (a cycle button for the state machine, a temp up, and a temp down buttons). My code is clean, neat, and well optimized. I do wish I learned more about the particular libaries used so I could further optimize my solutions, and I would like to add an automatic mode which can heat or cool as needed to maintain a target. This project allowed me to engage with breadboard wiring, hardware interfacing with my software, and multithreading capabilities, which are all useful tools to add to my support network. I also find these skills transferable to my future career, as I intend to work in VFDs and inverters in the near future, which requires a familiarity with embedded systems, hardware constraints, and careful development with hardware interfacing. This project is maintainable, readable, and adaptable since the functions are neatly separated and organized, the variables follow standard conventions and are fairly well-named, and new modes and elements can be neatly added as members of the state machine without much effort beyond implementation of that state's functionality.
